        <p><strong>Kishor <em>(Kesh)</em> Chhiba</strong> was introduced to forging when he was an apprentice for William Cables (Wellington) over 38 years ago – that makes him pretty old in today’s fast paced world! But it truly shows his passion for forging. He continues to create wonderful designs for his clients with the same passion today.<br><br>
         <strong>Mike Enoka</strong> has been working with Kesh for over 10 years, his attention to detail is sometimes overwhelming, but he gets it spot on every time! His ability to create living pieces of wrought iron work is truly amazing.<br><br>
         <strong>Marlti <em>(Marti)</em> Chhiba</strong> is the stay at work house wife! She will most likely be your first point of contact at our showroom, where she can help you start your project whether it be a gate, balustrade, a piece of furniture, garden product or simply a work of art you want made from metal.
